We have two main folders that indicate the backend and frontend of the project.

Backend:
I have created simple CRUD-supported API calls using Express without the use of any database.
To run the backend server, ensure that you have Node installed, and then follow these commands:
### Commands to run the backend server
```
cd Backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Frontend:
On the other hand, for the frontend, we have created a simple CRUD application using Vue3 & Quasar.
To run the frontend server, make sure you have Vue installed and then follow these commands:
### Commands to run the frontend server
```
cd Frontend/quasar-crud
npm install
npm run serve
```
